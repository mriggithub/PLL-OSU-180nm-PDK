PLL is Phase Locked loop which comprises of mainly Phase frequency detector (PFD), Low pass filter (LPF), Voltage cotrolled oscillator (VCO) and Frequency divider (FD).The main application of PLL as on chip multiplier is to increase or multiply the output frequency since the frequency generated by the crystal oscillator is not sufficient to increasing the processor speed. The task of each block is PLL are as follows:(i) PFD: There are two inputs in PFD, it mainly compares the phases/frequencies of the signals. (ii) LPF:Converts the pulsating output to a constant DC signal. (iii) VCO: Depending upon the voltage of the input signal the frquency of the output signal varies. (iv) FD: The frquency of the output signal is divided by the number of times it is increased. Particular in the circuit discussed below the frequency of the sigal is increased by eight times.
